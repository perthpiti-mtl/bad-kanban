# BMad Method Kanban Board Fullstack Architecture

## Introduction

This document outlines the complete fullstack architecture for BMad Method Kanban Board, including backend systems, frontend implementation, and their integration. It serves as the single source of truth for AI-driven development, ensuring consistency across the entire technology stack.

This unified approach combines what would traditionally be separate backend and frontend architecture documents, streamlining the development process for modern fullstack applications where these concerns are increasingly intertwined.

### Starter Template or Existing Project

Based on the PRD review and AI SDK selection, this is a **greenfield project** using SvelteKit with TypeScript and Vercel AI SDK integration.

**Updated Recommendation:**

- SvelteKit's official TypeScript template as foundation
- Vercel AI SDK for AI provider abstraction and streaming
- DaisyUI/Tailwind configuration
- Structure supports AI SDK's streaming patterns
- Docker configuration optimized for AI SDK usage

**Decision:** N/A - Greenfield project with SvelteKit + AI SDK foundation
