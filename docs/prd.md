# BMad Method Kanban Board Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals

• Demonstrate the effectiveness of the BMad Method through a practical, working application
• Create a modern, AI-enhanced Kanban board that showcases advanced development practices
• Provide a reference implementation using TypeScript, SvelteKit, and modern UI components
• Integrate AI capabilities for intelligent task management and search functionality
• Deliver a mobile-responsive web application suitable for cross-device productivity

### Background Context

This project serves as a practical demonstration of the BMad Method's capabilities in rapid, structured software development. The AI-enhanced Kanban board addresses the common productivity challenge where users struggle with task organization and retrieval. By incorporating intelligent task rewriting and semantic search capabilities, the application will showcase how AI can enhance traditional productivity tools while maintaining simplicity and usability.

The current landscape shows numerous Kanban tools, but few effectively integrate AI assistance for task management. This project will demonstrate how modern development frameworks (SvelteKit, TypeScript) combined with AI features can create superior user experiences while following structured development methodologies.

## User Interface Design Goals

### Overall UX Vision

Create a clean, modern, and intuitive Kanban interface that feels familiar to users while showcasing advanced AI integration. The design should emphasize clarity and ease of use, making the AI features feel natural rather than gimmicky. Users should experience seamless task management with AI assistance that feels like a helpful productivity partner rather than a complex tool.

### Key Interaction Paradigms

**Drag-and-Drop First:** Primary interaction for moving tasks between columns, with smooth animations and clear visual feedback
**Context-Aware AI:** AI features integrated contextually - task creation via floating action button, search via prominent search bar
**Touch-Optimized:** All interactions work seamlessly on mobile with appropriate touch targets and gestures
**Instant Feedback:** Real-time visual responses to all user actions, especially during AI processing

### Core Screens and Views

**Main Kanban Board:** Three-column layout with task cards, AI search bar, and floating add button
**Task Detail Modal:** Overlay for editing task details with all fields accessible
**AI Task Creator Modal:** Specialized interface for natural language task input with AI suggestions
**Settings/Preferences Panel:** Simple configuration for AI settings and user preferences

### Accessibility: WCAG AA

Full keyboard navigation support, proper ARIA labels, high contrast mode compatibility, and screen reader optimization for all interactive elements including drag-and-drop operations.

### Branding

Clean, professional aesthetic using DaisyUI's default theme with subtle AI-inspired visual cues (gentle gradients, smart animations). Focus on demonstrating component library integration rather than custom branding.

### Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive

Optimized for all screen sizes from mobile phones (320px+) to large desktop displays, with particular attention to tablet landscape mode for productive task management.

## Technical Assumptions

### Repository Structure: Monorepo

Single repository structure appropriate for this demonstration project, keeping all components, utilities, and configuration in one cohesive codebase for easy BMad Method showcase.

### Service Architecture

**Monolith Architecture:** Single SvelteKit application with integrated AI service calls. This approach simplifies deployment and demonstrates full-stack development within the BMad Method while maintaining clear separation of concerns through well-structured modules.

**Rationale:** For a demonstration project, monolith architecture provides the best balance of simplicity and functionality showcase, allowing developers to see complete end-to-end implementation patterns.

### Testing Requirements

**Unit + Integration Testing:** Comprehensive testing pyramid including Vitest for unit tests, Playwright for integration/E2E testing, and component testing for Svelte components. Manual testing convenience methods for AI feature validation.

**Rationale:** Demonstrates professional testing practices within BMad Method while ensuring AI features work reliably across different scenarios.

### Additional Technical Assumptions and Requests

**Frontend Framework:** SvelteKit with TypeScript (strict mode) for type safety and modern development experience

**UI Framework:** DaisyUI components with Tailwind CSS for rapid, consistent styling and responsive design

**AI Integration:** OpenAI API (GPT-4) for task rewriting and semantic search capabilities, with proper error handling and fallback states

**State Management:** Svelte stores for application state with localStorage persistence for demonstration purposes

**Build Tools:** Vite-based build system (SvelteKit default) with TypeScript configuration

**Code Quality:** ESLint + Prettier for code formatting, with strict TypeScript configuration

**Deployment Target:** Docker containerization with multi-stage build for production optimization, enabling deployment to any container-compatible platform (Docker Compose, Kubernetes, cloud container services)

**Browser Support:** Modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge - latest 2 versions) with progressive enhancement

**Performance:** Code splitting and lazy loading for optimal bundle sizes, with focus on First Contentful Paint optimization

**Security:** Environment variable management for API keys, input sanitization for AI interactions

**Container Strategy:** Alpine-based Node.js container for minimal footprint, with proper health checks and non-root user configuration
