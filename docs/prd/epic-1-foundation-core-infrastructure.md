# Epic 1: Foundation & Core Infrastructure

**Epic Goal:** Establish SvelteKit project foundation with TypeScript, DaisyUI/Tailwind setup, basic routing, and containerized deployment pipeline while delivering a functional basic Kanban board that demonstrates core BMad Method development practices and provides immediate user value through task visualization.

## Story 1.1: Project Initialization and Development Environment

As a developer,
I want a properly configured SvelteKit project with TypeScript and all necessary tooling,
so that I have a solid foundation for building the Kanban application with type safety and modern development practices.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. SvelteKit project created with TypeScript configuration and strict mode enabled
2. DaisyUI and Tailwind CSS installed and properly configured with basic theme setup
3. ESLint and Prettier configured for code quality and consistent formatting
4. Development server runs successfully with hot module replacement
5. Project structure follows SvelteKit conventions with clear organization
6. Package.json includes all necessary dependencies and development scripts
7. Basic routing setup with placeholder home page loads without errors

## Story 1.2: Basic Kanban Layout and Visual Structure

As a user,
I want to see a clean three-column Kanban board layout,
so that I can understand the application structure and begin organizing tasks visually.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. Three columns displayed: "To Do", "In Progress", and "Done"
2. Responsive layout works on desktop (1024px+), tablet (768px-1023px), and mobile (320px-767px)
3. DaisyUI components used for consistent styling and visual hierarchy
4. Column headers clearly labeled with appropriate contrast and typography
5. Empty state message displayed when no tasks exist in columns
6. Layout maintains proper spacing and alignment across all screen sizes
7. Page loads within 2 seconds and displays without layout shifts

## Story 1.3: Task Card Display and Static Data

As a user,
I want to see sample task cards in the Kanban columns,
so that I can understand how tasks will be presented and verify the layout works with content.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. Sample task cards displayed with title, description, and priority indicators
2. Cards use DaisyUI card components with consistent styling
3. Task cards properly sized and spaced within columns
4. Different priority levels visually distinguished (high, medium, low)
5. Cards display truncated descriptions with full text available on hover/tap
6. Sample data includes realistic task content demonstrating various use cases
7. Cards maintain readability and visual hierarchy on all screen sizes

## Story 1.4: Container Configuration and Deployment Pipeline

As a developer,
I want the application containerized with Docker and deployable,
so that I can demonstrate professional deployment practices and ensure consistent environments.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. Multi-stage Dockerfile created with optimized production build
2. Alpine-based Node.js container with non-root user configuration
3. Docker Compose configuration for local development environment
4. Health check endpoint implemented and tested
5. Environment variable management for configuration
6. Build and deployment process documented in README
7. Container successfully runs the application and serves on specified port
