# Epic 2: Core Kanban Functionality

**Epic Goal:** Transform the static Kanban layout into a fully functional task management system with complete CRUD operations, drag-and-drop interactions, localStorage persistence, and mobile-optimized touch controls, delivering a production-ready Kanban board that users can immediately use for productivity.

## Story 2.1: Task Creation Modal and Form

As a user,
I want to create new tasks through a user-friendly modal interface,
so that I can quickly add tasks with all necessary information to my Kanban board.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. Floating action button (FAB) triggers task creation modal on all screen sizes
2. Modal contains form fields: title (required), description, priority selector, due date picker
3. DaisyUI form components used with proper validation and error messaging
4. Priority selector offers High, Medium, Low options with visual indicators
5. Date picker allows future date selection with keyboard accessibility
6. Form validation prevents submission with empty title and provides clear error feedback
7. New tasks default to "To Do" column and appear immediately after creation
8. Modal closes automatically after successful task creation with success feedback

## Story 2.2: Task Editing and Update Functionality

As a user,
I want to edit existing tasks by clicking on them,
so that I can update task information as requirements change or details become clearer.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. Clicking any task card opens edit modal with current values pre-populated
2. All task fields (title, description, priority, due date) are editable
3. Save button updates task data and refreshes card display immediately
4. Cancel button closes modal without saving changes
5. Delete button within edit modal removes task with confirmation dialog
6. Form validation identical to creation modal with appropriate error handling
7. Visual feedback indicates when task is being updated or deleted
8. Edit modal responsive and accessible on mobile devices with proper touch targets

## Story 2.3: Drag and Drop Task Movement

As a user,
I want to drag tasks between columns,
so that I can easily update task status as work progresses through different stages.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. Desktop users can drag tasks smoothly between all three columns
2. Visual feedback during drag operation (ghost image, drop zones highlighted)
3. Drop zones clearly indicated when dragging over valid targets
4. Tasks snap into proper position within target column
5. Drag operation updates task status automatically (To Do, In Progress, Done)
6. Mobile users can drag tasks using touch gestures with haptic feedback
7. Invalid drop attempts provide clear visual feedback and return task to origin
8. Drag operations work smoothly on all supported browsers and devices

## Story 2.4: Data Persistence and State Management

As a user,
I want my tasks to be saved automatically and persist between browser sessions,
so that I don't lose my work when I close and reopen the application.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. All task data automatically saved to localStorage after any create/update/delete operation
2. Application loads previously saved tasks when user returns to the site
3. Svelte stores manage application state with reactive updates across components
4. Data structure supports all task properties (title, description, priority, due date, status, created/updated timestamps)
5. Storage operations handle edge cases (storage full, corrupted data) gracefully
6. Performance optimized to avoid blocking UI during save operations
7. Clear indication when data is being saved or loaded
8. Data migration strategy handles future schema changes
