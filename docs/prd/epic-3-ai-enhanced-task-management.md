# Epic 3: AI-Enhanced Task Management

**Epic Goal:** Transform the basic Kanban board into an intelligent productivity tool by integrating OpenAI API for natural language task creation and semantic search capabilities, demonstrating how AI can enhance traditional productivity workflows while maintaining intuitive user experience and robust error handling.

## Story 3.1: AI Task Creation Service Integration

As a developer,
I want to integrate OpenAI API for natural language processing,
so that the application can intelligently rewrite user input into structured task information.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. OpenAI API client configured with proper authentication and error handling
2. Environment variable management for API keys with fallback configuration
3. Service layer abstracts AI operations from UI components
4. Rate limiting and request queuing implemented to prevent API abuse
5. Timeout handling for API requests with appropriate fallback behavior
6. TypeScript interfaces defined for API requests and responses
7. Unit tests cover API integration with mocked responses
8. Logging system tracks AI service usage and errors for monitoring

## Story 3.2: Intelligent Task Creator Interface

As a user,
I want to describe what I need to do in natural language and have it converted to a structured task,
so that I can quickly capture tasks without worrying about formatting or structure.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. Alternative task creation flow accessible via "Smart Create" button or toggle
2. Natural language input field with placeholder examples ("Prepare for client meeting tomorrow")
3. AI processing indicator shows progress while request is being processed
4. Generated task preview displays proposed title, description, and suggested priority
5. User can accept AI suggestions or manually edit before saving
6. Fallback to manual creation if AI service unavailable with clear messaging
7. AI suggestions improve task clarity and actionability compared to original input
8. Processing completes within 3 seconds for typical requests with progress feedback

## Story 3.3: AI-Powered Task Search

As a user,
I want to search for existing tasks using natural language queries,
so that I can quickly find relevant tasks without remembering exact titles or browsing all cards.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. Prominent search bar integrated into main Kanban interface
2. Natural language search queries processed through AI semantic understanding
3. Search results highlighted within existing Kanban columns with visual emphasis
4. Multiple matching tasks displayed with relevance scoring
5. Search suggestions appear as user types with debounced API calls
6. Clear button resets search and returns to full task view
7. Search works across all task fields (title, description, priority, status)
8. No results state provides helpful guidance and suggestion to refine search

## Story 3.4: AI Feature Error Handling and Fallbacks

As a user,
I want the application to work reliably even when AI services are unavailable,
so that I can continue using the Kanban board for productivity regardless of external service status.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. Graceful degradation when OpenAI API is unavailable or rate-limited
2. Clear error messages explain AI service issues without technical jargon
3. Manual task creation and search remain fully functional as fallback options
4. Offline indicator shows when AI features are temporarily unavailable
5. Retry mechanisms attempt to restore AI functionality automatically
6. User preferences allow disabling AI features entirely if desired
7. Error tracking and reporting for AI service issues without exposing sensitive data
8. Performance monitoring ensures AI features don't slow down core Kanban functionality
