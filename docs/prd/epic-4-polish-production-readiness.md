# Epic 4: Polish & Production Readiness

**Epic Goal:** Transform the functional AI-enhanced Kanban board into a production-quality demonstration that showcases BMad Method excellence through comprehensive testing, accessibility compliance, performance optimization, and professional documentation, ensuring the application serves as a compelling example of structured development practices.

## Story 4.1: Comprehensive Testing Suite

As a developer,
I want a complete testing strategy covering all application functionality,
so that I can demonstrate professional testing practices and ensure reliable application behavior.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. Vitest unit tests cover all utility functions, stores, and service layers with 90%+ coverage
2. Svelte component tests verify UI behavior and user interactions
3. Playwright E2E tests cover critical user journeys (create, edit, delete, drag-drop tasks)
4. AI integration tests with mocked API responses validate error handling scenarios
5. Visual regression tests ensure UI consistency across different screen sizes
6. Performance tests verify load times and interaction responsiveness
7. Test documentation explains testing strategy and how to run test suites
8. CI pipeline runs all tests automatically with coverage reporting

## Story 4.2: Accessibility and Performance Optimization

As a user with accessibility needs,
I want the application to be fully accessible and performant,
so that I can use the Kanban board effectively regardless of my abilities or device limitations.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. WCAG AA compliance verified through automated testing and manual audit
2. Keyboard navigation works for all interactive elements including drag-drop
3. Screen reader compatibility tested with proper ARIA labels and announcements
4. High contrast mode support with appropriate color selections
5. Performance optimization achieves Lighthouse scores: 90+ in all categories
6. Bundle size analysis and optimization with code splitting for optimal loading
7. Responsive design tested across device matrix (mobile, tablet, desktop)
8. Focus management ensures logical tab order and visible focus indicators

## Story 4.3: Error Handling and User Experience Polish

As a user,
I want the application to handle all error scenarios gracefully with helpful messaging,
so that I have a smooth, professional experience even when things go wrong.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. Global error boundary catches and displays user-friendly error messages
2. Network failure scenarios handled with appropriate retry mechanisms
3. Form validation provides specific, actionable error messages
4. Loading states and progress indicators for all async operations
5. Empty states provide helpful guidance and call-to-action buttons
6. Toast notifications confirm successful actions without being intrusive
7. Offline detection and appropriate messaging when connection is lost
8. Data validation prevents corruption from malformed localStorage content

## Story 4.4: Documentation and Deployment Guide

As a developer interested in BMad Method,
I want comprehensive documentation explaining the project structure and development process,
so that I can understand how BMad Method principles were applied and replicate the approach.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. README.md provides clear setup instructions, feature overview, and demo screenshots
2. Development documentation explains project structure and coding conventions
3. BMad Method case study documents how structured development practices were applied
4. API documentation covers all service interfaces and error handling
5. Docker deployment guide with environment configuration examples
6. Troubleshooting section addresses common setup and runtime issues
7. Contributing guidelines explain code quality standards and testing requirements
8. Demo deployment available with sample data for immediate evaluation
