# Goals and Background Context

## Goals

• Demonstrate the effectiveness of the BMad Method through a practical, working application
• Create a modern, AI-enhanced Kanban board that showcases advanced development practices
• Provide a reference implementation using TypeScript, SvelteKit, and modern UI components
• Integrate AI capabilities for intelligent task management and search functionality
• Deliver a mobile-responsive web application suitable for cross-device productivity

## Background Context

This project serves as a practical demonstration of the BMad Method's capabilities in rapid, structured software development. The AI-enhanced Kanban board addresses the common productivity challenge where users struggle with task organization and retrieval. By incorporating intelligent task rewriting and semantic search capabilities, the application will showcase how AI can enhance traditional productivity tools while maintaining simplicity and usability.

The current landscape shows numerous Kanban tools, but few effectively integrate AI assistance for task management. This project will demonstrate how modern development frameworks (SvelteKit, TypeScript) combined with AI features can create superior user experiences while following structured development methodologies.
