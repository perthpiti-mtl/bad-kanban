# Technical Assumptions

## Repository Structure: Monorepo

Single repository structure appropriate for this demonstration project, keeping all components, utilities, and configuration in one cohesive codebase for easy BMad Method showcase.

## Service Architecture

**Monolith Architecture:** Single SvelteKit application with integrated AI service calls. This approach simplifies deployment and demonstrates full-stack development within the BMad Method while maintaining clear separation of concerns through well-structured modules.

**Rationale:** For a demonstration project, monolith architecture provides the best balance of simplicity and functionality showcase, allowing developers to see complete end-to-end implementation patterns.

## Testing Requirements

**Unit + Integration Testing:** Comprehensive testing pyramid including Vitest for unit tests, Playwright for integration/E2E testing, and component testing for Svelte components. Manual testing convenience methods for AI feature validation.

**Rationale:** Demonstrates professional testing practices within BMad Method while ensuring AI features work reliably across different scenarios.

## Additional Technical Assumptions and Requests

**Frontend Framework:** SvelteKit with TypeScript (strict mode) for type safety and modern development experience

**UI Framework:** DaisyUI components with Tailwind CSS for rapid, consistent styling and responsive design

**AI Integration:** OpenAI API (GPT-4) for task rewriting and semantic search capabilities, with proper error handling and fallback states

**State Management:** Svelte stores for application state with localStorage persistence for demonstration purposes

**Build Tools:** Vite-based build system (SvelteKit default) with TypeScript configuration

**Code Quality:** ESLint + Prettier for code formatting, with strict TypeScript configuration

**Deployment Target:** Docker containerization with multi-stage build for production optimization, enabling deployment to any container-compatible platform (Docker Compose, Kubernetes, cloud container services)

**Browser Support:** Modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge - latest 2 versions) with progressive enhancement

**Performance:** Code splitting and lazy loading for optimal bundle sizes, with focus on First Contentful Paint optimization

**Security:** Environment variable management for API keys, input sanitization for AI interactions

**Container Strategy:** Alpine-based Node.js container for minimal footprint, with proper health checks and non-root user configuration
