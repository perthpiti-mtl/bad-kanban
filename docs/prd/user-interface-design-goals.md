# User Interface Design Goals

## Overall UX Vision

Create a clean, modern, and intuitive Kanban interface that feels familiar to users while showcasing advanced AI integration. The design should emphasize clarity and ease of use, making the AI features feel natural rather than gimmicky. Users should experience seamless task management with AI assistance that feels like a helpful productivity partner rather than a complex tool.

## Key Interaction Paradigms

**Drag-and-Drop First:** Primary interaction for moving tasks between columns, with smooth animations and clear visual feedback
**Context-Aware AI:** AI features integrated contextually - task creation via floating action button, search via prominent search bar
**Touch-Optimized:** All interactions work seamlessly on mobile with appropriate touch targets and gestures
**Instant Feedback:** Real-time visual responses to all user actions, especially during AI processing

## Core Screens and Views

**Main Kanban Board:** Three-column layout with task cards, AI search bar, and floating add button
**Task Detail Modal:** Overlay for editing task details with all fields accessible
**AI Task Creator Modal:** Specialized interface for natural language task input with AI suggestions
**Settings/Preferences Panel:** Simple configuration for AI settings and user preferences

## Accessibility: WCAG AA

Full keyboard navigation support, proper ARIA labels, high contrast mode compatibility, and screen reader optimization for all interactive elements including drag-and-drop operations.

## Branding

Clean, professional aesthetic using DaisyUI's default theme with subtle AI-inspired visual cues (gentle gradients, smart animations). Focus on demonstrating component library integration rather than custom branding.

## Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive

Optimized for all screen sizes from mobile phones (320px+) to large desktop displays, with particular attention to tablet landscape mode for productive task management.
