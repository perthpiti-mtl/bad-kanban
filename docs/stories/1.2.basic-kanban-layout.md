# Story 1.2: Basic Kanban Layout and Visual Structure

## Status

Done

## Story

**As a** user,  
**I want** to see a clean three-column Kanban board layout,  
**so that** I can understand the application structure and begin organizing tasks visually.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Three columns displayed: "To Do", "In Progress", and "Done"
2. Responsive layout works on desktop (1024px+), tablet (768px-1023px), and mobile (320px-767px)
3. DaisyUI components used for consistent styling and visual hierarchy
4. Column headers clearly labeled with appropriate contrast and typography
5. Empty state message displayed when no tasks exist in columns
6. Layout maintains proper spacing and alignment across all screen sizes
7. Page loads within 2 seconds and displays without layout shifts

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

From Story 1.1 completion:
- SvelteKit foundation established with TypeScript strict mode
- DaisyUI + Tailwind CSS properly configured and operational  
- Project structure aligns with architecture requirements
- All development tooling (ESLint, Prettier, build scripts) working
- Basic routing structure ready for Kanban board implementation

### Component Architecture

[Source: docs/architecture.md#component-architecture]

The components should be organized as:
```
src/lib/components/
├── kanban/                # Kanban-specific components
│   ├── KanbanBoard.svelte
│   ├── KanbanColumn.svelte
│   └── TaskCard.svelte    # For future story
└── ui/                    # Reusable UI components
    ├── Button.svelte
    ├── Modal.svelte
    └── LoadingSpinner.svelte
```

### Data Models

[Source: docs/architecture.md#data-models]

Basic task structure to implement:
```typescript
export interface Task {
  id: string
  title: string
  description: string
  status: TaskStatus
  priority: Priority
  dueDate: Date | null
  createdAt: Date
  updatedAt: Date
  aiGenerated: boolean
  originalPrompt: string | null
}

export type TaskStatus = 'todo' | 'in-progress' | 'done'
export type Priority = 'high' | 'medium' | 'low'
```

### Frontend Architecture Patterns

[Source: docs/architecture.md#frontend-architecture]

- **Component Template**: Follow the established pattern with TypeScript, props, event dispatch, and proper styling
- **State Management**: Use Svelte stores for reactive updates (implement in future story)
- **DaisyUI Integration**: Use card, grid, and typography components for consistent styling
- **Responsive Design**: Leverage Tailwind's responsive utilities (sm:, md:, lg:, xl:)

### File Locations

[Source: docs/architecture.md#unified-project-structure]

Components must be created in these exact locations:
- `src/lib/components/kanban/KanbanBoard.svelte` - Main board component
- `src/lib/components/kanban/KanbanColumn.svelte` - Individual column component
- `src/lib/types/index.ts` - TypeScript interfaces and types
- `src/routes/+page.svelte` - Main page integration

### DaisyUI Component Guidelines

[Source: docs/architecture.md#ui-component-library]

Use these DaisyUI classes for consistency:
- **Layout**: `grid`, `grid-cols-3`, `gap-4`, `container`, `mx-auto`
- **Cards**: `card`, `card-body`, `card-title` for column containers
- **Typography**: `text-lg`, `font-semibold`, `text-base-content` for headers
- **Responsive**: `grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-3` for mobile-first responsive design
- **Spacing**: `p-4`, `m-2`, `space-y-4` following DaisyUI spacing scale

### Technical Constraints

[Source: docs/architecture.md#tech-stack]

- **TypeScript Strict Mode**: All components must pass TypeScript validation
- **Performance Target**: Page load within 2 seconds (AC: 7)
- **Browser Support**: Modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge - latest 2 versions)
- **Mobile Support**: Touch-friendly interface with proper spacing

### Testing

[Source: docs/architecture.md#testing-strategy]

Testing requirements for this story:
- **Test Location**: `tests/unit/components/kanban/`
- **Testing Framework**: Vitest with Svelte testing library
- **Test Coverage**: Component rendering, responsive behavior, empty states
- **E2E Tests**: Basic layout verification across screen sizes
- **Accessibility Tests**: Proper heading structure and semantic HTML

This story focuses on visual structure only - no interactive functionality yet. Testing should verify layout rendering and responsive behavior.
