## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

From Story 1.2 completion:
- Three-column Kanban layout successfully established with responsive design
- KanbanBoard and KanbanColumn components created with DaisyUI integration
- Task data model already defined in `src/lib/types/index.ts` with comprehensive TypeScript interfaces
- Empty state messaging implemented and working correctly
- Accessibility features enhanced during QA review including ARIA labels and semantic HTML
- Performance optimizations added with reactive statements and completion metrics

### Component Architecture

[Source: docs/architecture/components.md#ui-component-library]

TaskCard component should follow established UI Component Library patterns:
- **Svelte component props and events**: Standard event dispatcher pattern
- **DaisyUI component integration**: Utilize card, badge, and tooltip components
- **Tailwind CSS utility classes**: Follow responsive-first design approach
- **Accessibility (ARIA) attributes**: Proper semantic markup for screen readers

Component hierarchy for this story:
```
KanbanBoard.svelte
  └── KanbanColumn.svelte
      └── TaskCard.svelte (NEW)
```

### Data Models

[Source: docs/architecture/data-models.md#task]

Complete Task interface already implemented in `src/lib/types/index.ts`:
```typescript
export interface Task {
  id: string
  title: string
  description: string
  status: TaskStatus
  priority: Priority
  dueDate: Date | null
  createdAt: Date
  updatedAt: Date
  aiGenerated: boolean
  originalPrompt: string | null
}

export type TaskStatus = 'todo' | 'in-progress' | 'done'
export type Priority = 'high' | 'medium' | 'low'
```

### File Locations

[Source: docs/architecture/unified-project-structure.md#component-organization]

Components must be created in these exact locations:
- `src/lib/components/kanban/TaskCard.svelte` - Individual task card component
- Update `src/lib/components/kanban/KanbanColumn.svelte` - Remove placeholder task rendering
- Sample data integration in main page or component as appropriate

### Svelte Component Standards

[Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#svelte-component-standards]

TaskCard component must follow established patterns:
```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  // 1. Imports (external libraries first, then local)
  import { createEventDispatcher } from 'svelte'
  import type { Task } from '$lib/types'
  
  // 2. Props (with defaults where appropriate)
  export let task: Task
  export let variant: 'default' | 'compact' = 'default'
  
  // 3. Event dispatcher
  const dispatch = createEventDispatcher<{
    click: { task: Task }
    edit: { taskId: string }
  }>()
  
  // 4. Reactive statements
  $: priorityClass = getPriorityClass(task.priority)
  
  // 5. Functions
  function handleClick() {
    dispatch('click', { task })
  }
</script>
```

### DaisyUI Component Guidelines

[Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#css-styling-standards]

Use these DaisyUI classes for TaskCard styling:
- **Card Structure**: `card`, `card-body`, `card-compact` for main container
- **Typography**: `card-title`, `text-base-content`, `text-sm` for content hierarchy
- **Badges**: `badge`, `badge-primary`, `badge-error` for priority indicators
- **Interactive States**: `hover:bg-base-200`, `focus:ring-2`, `cursor-pointer`
- **Responsive**: `text-sm md:text-base` for adaptive text sizing

### Priority Visual System

[Source: docs/architecture/data-models.md#task]

Priority indicators should use semantic DaisyUI colors:
- **High Priority**: `badge-error` (red) - urgent tasks requiring immediate attention
- **Medium Priority**: `badge-warning` (yellow) - standard priority tasks
- **Low Priority**: `badge-info` (blue) - nice-to-have or low urgency tasks

### Technical Constraints

[Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]

- **TypeScript Strict Mode**: All components must pass TypeScript validation
- **Performance Target**: Fast rendering with efficient reactive updates
- **Browser Support**: Modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge - latest 2 versions)
- **Mobile Support**: Touch-friendly interface with proper spacing and tap targets

  updatedAt: new Date().toISOString(),
  aiGenerated: false,
  originalPrompt: null
}
```

### Accessibility Requirements

[Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#accessibility]
