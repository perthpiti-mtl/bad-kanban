## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

From Story 1.3 completion:
- SvelteKit application is fully functional with DaisyUI/Tailwind styling
- TypeScript configuration is properly set up with strict mode
- Testing framework (Vitest) configured but environment needs refinement
- Project structure follows unified architecture guidelines
- Application successfully serves on development server

### Container Architecture Requirements

[Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]

Container platform specifications:
- **Docker**: ^24.0.0 for application containerization (PRD requirement)
- **Alpine Linux**: Lightweight base image for production deployments
- **Node.js Runtime**: Matching project development version for consistency
- **Multi-stage Build**: Optimize for production bundle size and security

### Project Structure Context

[Source: docs/architecture/unified-project-structure.md]

Docker configuration should be organized as follows:
- **`docker/`** - Docker configuration directory
  - `Dockerfile` - Multi-stage production build
  - `docker-compose.yml` - Local development setup
  - `.dockerignore` - Docker build context exclusions
- **`scripts/`** - Build and deployment scripts
  - `build.sh` - Production build automation
  - `deploy.sh` - Deployment automation

### SvelteKit Build Configuration

[Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md#build-tool]

Build process requirements:
- **Vite**: ^5.0.0 - Development server and bundling (built into SvelteKit)
- **Rollup**: Via Vite - Production bundling with optimal bundle sizes
- **Package Manager**: yarn ^4.0.0 - Fast, modern package manager
- **Output**: Static files suitable for containerized deployment

### Environment Configuration

[Source: docs/architecture/unified-project-structure.md#environment]

Environment variable management:
- **`.env.example`** - Environment variable template for documentation
- **Runtime Configuration** - Support for environment-specific settings
- **Security**: No hardcoded secrets, all sensitive config via environment variables

### Health Check Implementation

Based on SvelteKit API routes pattern:
- **Location**: `src/routes/api/health/+server.ts`
- **Response Format**: JSON with status, timestamp, and basic metrics
- **Docker Integration**: Configure HEALTHCHECK directive with appropriate intervals
- **Monitoring**: Basic application monitoring suitable for demonstration

### Docker Security Best Practices

[Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#security-standards]

Security requirements:
- **Non-root User**: Create and use dedicated application user
- **Minimal Image**: Alpine-based for reduced attack surface
- **Layer Optimization**: Minimize layers and optimize for caching
- **Secret Management**: Environment variables for configuration, no embedded secrets

### Port and Network Configuration

Default configuration based on SvelteKit conventions:
- **Development Port**: 5173 (Vite dev server default)
- **Production Port**: 3000 (configurable via environment variables)
- **Health Check Port**: Same as application port
- **Docker Networking**: Standard bridge networking for local development

### Build Performance Requirements

[Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md#build-tool]

Performance targets:
- **Build Speed**: Optimize Docker layer caching for faster builds
- **Image Size**: Minimize production image size with multi-stage builds
- **Startup Time**: Fast container startup for development workflow
- **Hot Reload**: Volume mounts for development mode hot module replacement

## Testing

[Source: docs/architecture/testing-strategy.md#integration-test-guidelines]

### Test File Location
- Container and deployment tests should be included in integration test suite
- Health check endpoint testing in `tests/integration/api/health.test.ts`
- Docker functionality testing via build scripts and CI/CD pipeline

### Testing Requirements for This Story
- Verify Docker image builds successfully without errors
- Test health check endpoint responds correctly with expected format
- Validate container runs application and serves on specified port
- Ensure environment variable injection works correctly
- Test development Docker Compose setup with hot reload
- Verify non-root user configuration and file permissions

### Testing Standards
- **Container Testing**: Verify image builds, runs, and serves correctly
- **Health Check Testing**: Validate endpoint format and response times  
- **Security Testing**: Confirm non-root user operation and no exposed secrets
- **Performance Testing**: Monitor container startup times and resource usage
