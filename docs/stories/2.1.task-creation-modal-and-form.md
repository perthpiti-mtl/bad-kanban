# Story 2.1: Task Creation Modal and Form

## Status

DONE

## Story

**As a** user,  
**I want** to create new tasks through a user-friendly modal interface,  
**so that** I can quickly add tasks with all necessary information to my Kanban board.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Floating action button (FAB) triggers task creation modal on all screen sizes
2. Modal contains form fields: title (required), description, priority selector, due date picker
3. DaisyUI form components used with proper validation and error messaging
4. Priority selector offers High, Medium, Low options with visual indicators
5. Date picker allows future date selection with keyboard accessibility
6. Form validation prevents submission with empty title and provides clear error feedback
7. New tasks default to "To Do" column and appear immediately after creation
8. Modal closes automatically after successful task creation with success feedback

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

From Story 1.4 completion:
- SvelteKit application is fully containerized and deployment-ready
- DaisyUI/Tailwind styling system is established and working
- Svelte stores pattern is available for state management
- Component structure follows unified architecture guidelines
- Testing framework (Vitest) is configured for unit and integration tests

### SvelteKit Component Architecture

[Source: docs/architecture/components.md, docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]

Component development should follow established patterns:
- **Component Location**: `src/lib/components/` - organized by feature area
- **Story Integration**: Each component should have corresponding Storybook story
- **TypeScript**: Strict typing enabled, interfaces defined in `src/lib/types/`
- **Styling**: DaisyUI component classes with Tailwind utilities for customization

### Modal Implementation Strategy

[Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md#ui-framework]

Modal requirements based on DaisyUI patterns:
- **DaisyUI Modal**: Use `modal` and `modal-box` classes for structure
- **State Management**: Svelte stores for modal open/close state
- **Accessibility**: Built-in ARIA attributes, focus management, keyboard navigation
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with proper viewport handling

### Form Validation and State Management

[Source: docs/architecture/unified-project-structure.md#state-management]

Form implementation guidelines:
- **Svelte Reactive Statements**: Use `$:` for real-time validation
- **Form State**: Manage form data with writable stores
- **Error Handling**: Clear error messaging with DaisyUI alert components
- **Validation**: Client-side validation with appropriate feedback timing

### Task Data Structure

Based on existing sample data patterns:
- **Core Fields**: id, title, description, priority, dueDate, status, createdAt, updatedAt
- **Priority Enum**: 'High' | 'Medium' | 'Low' with corresponding visual indicators
- **Status Enum**: 'To Do' | 'In Progress' | 'Done' (matching column structure)
- **TypeScript Interfaces**: Define in `src/lib/types/index.ts`

### Integration with Existing Kanban Components

[Source: current component structure]

Integration points:
- **KanbanBoard.svelte**: Will need to consume new task creation events
- **TaskCard.svelte**: May need updates to display new task properties
- **Sample Data**: Replace static sample-tasks.ts with dynamic task management
- **State Synchronization**: Ensure modal and board components share task state

### Performance Considerations

[Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md#performance]

Performance requirements:
- **Bundle Size**: Minimize dependencies, use tree-shaking compatible imports
- **Reactive Updates**: Optimize Svelte reactivity to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- **Form Performance**: Debounce validation for better UX
- **Modal Animation**: Use CSS transitions for smooth open/close animations

### Testing

[Source: docs/architecture/testing-strategy.md#unit-test-guidelines]

### Test File Location
- Modal component tests: `tests/unit/components/modals/TaskCreationModal.test.ts`
- FAB component tests: `tests/unit/components/ui/FloatingActionButton.test.ts`
- Form validation tests: `tests/unit/components/forms/TaskForm.test.ts`
- Integration tests: `tests/integration/task-creation-flow.test.ts`

### Testing Standards
- **Component Testing**: Test component rendering, props, events, and user interactions
- **Form Testing**: Validate form submission, validation logic, error states
- **Modal Testing**: Test open/close behavior, accessibility, keyboard navigation
- **Integration Testing**: End-to-end task creation flow from FAB click to task appearance

### Testing Requirements for This Story
- Verify FAB appears correctly on all screen sizes and triggers modal
- Test form validation prevents empty title submission with clear error feedback
- Validate priority selector and date picker functionality
- Confirm new tasks appear in "To Do" column immediately after creation
- Test modal accessibility with keyboard navigation and screen readers
- Verify success feedback appears and modal closes after task creation
