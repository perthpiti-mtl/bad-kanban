## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

From Story 2.1 completion:
- TaskCreationModal pattern established with DaisyUI modal components and Svelte stores
- Form validation patterns available for reuse with reactive statements
- Task store actions (add, remove) implemented - need to add update action
- Modal state management working with proper accessibility features
- Known issues: 2 failing TaskCard component tests need addressing during this story

### SvelteKit Component Architecture

[Source: docs/architecture/components.md, docs/architecture/unified-project-structure.md]

**Component Location Strategy:**
- **Modal Components**: Place TaskEditModal.svelte in `src/lib/components/modals/` alongside TaskCreationModal
- **Confirmation Dialog**: Create reusable ConfirmDialog component in `src/lib/components/ui/`
- **Form Reuse**: Leverage existing form validation patterns from TaskCreationModal
- **Storybook Stories**: Each component MUST have corresponding .stories.svelte file for documentation

### Task Data Model and State Management

[Source: docs/architecture/data-models.md, previous story implementation]

**Task Interface (existing):**
```typescript
interface Task {
  id: string
  title: string
  description: string
  status: TaskStatus
  priority: Priority
  dueDate: Date | null
  createdAt: Date
  updatedAt: Date
  aiGenerated: boolean
  originalPrompt: string | null
}

type TaskStatus = 'todo' | 'in-progress' | 'done'
type Priority = 'high' | 'medium' | 'low'
```

**Required Store Actions:**
- Add `updateTask(id: string, updates: Partial<Task>)` to task store
- Update `updatedAt` timestamp on task modifications
- Maintain localStorage persistence with immediate UI reactivity

### Modal Implementation Strategy

[Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md#ui-framework, previous story patterns]

**DaisyUI Modal Pattern (established):**
- Use existing modal structure with `modal` and `modal-box` classes
- Leverage Svelte stores for modal open/close state management
- Implement proper focus management and keyboard navigation
- Ensure mobile-first responsive design with touch-friendly targets

**Zod Validation Implementation:**
- Replace existing validation with TypeScript-first Zod schemas for type safety
- Create comprehensive schemas in `src/lib/types/schemas.ts` with proper validation rules
- Implement consistent validation across forms, stores, and API endpoints
- Leverage Zod's built-in error formatting for clear user feedback
- Use Zod's automatic TypeScript type inference to ensure type consistency
- Maintain DaisyUI error styling patterns with Zod validation messages

### Component Interaction Patterns

[Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md, established patterns]

**TaskCard Click Handling:**
- Distinguish between edit click and drag-and-drop operations
- Use event delegation to prevent conflicts with drag events
- Implement proper keyboard accessibility (Enter key support)
- Emit semantic event names ('edit') for parent communication

**Modal State Coordination:**
- Use central modal state store if multiple modals exist
- Prevent multiple modals from opening simultaneously  
- Handle modal backdrop clicks and ESC key closing
- Clear form state on modal close/cancel

### Delete Confirmation Strategy

[Source: docs/architecture/components.md#ui-component-library]

**Confirmation Dialog Component:**
- Create reusable ConfirmDialog component with DaisyUI styling
- Support configurable messages and action buttons
- Implement proper focus management during confirmation flow
- Use semantic button styling (danger theme for delete actions)

### Testing Requirements

[Source: docs/architecture/testing-strategy.md#unit-test-guidelines]

**Test File Locations:**
- TaskEditModal tests: `tests/unit/components/modals/TaskEditModal.test.ts`

### Performance Considerations

[Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md#performance]

**Modal Performance:**
- Reuse modal component instances to minimize DOM manipulation
- Use CSS transitions for smooth open/close animations
- Implement proper component cleanup on destroy
- Optimize form reactivity to prevent unnecessary re-renders

**State Update Optimization:**
- Use functional state updates with spread operators
- Minimize localStorage write operations during editing
- Batch multiple field updates when possible
- Ensure derived state calculations remain performant

### Integration Notes

**Existing Component Updates Required:**
- `TaskCard.svelte`: Add click handler for edit functionality
- `KanbanBoard.svelte`: Handle edit modal state management
- `src/lib/stores/tasks.ts`: Add updateTask action and deleteTask confirmation
- Consider refactoring common form logic into shared utilities

**Project Structure Alignment:**
- All new components follow established naming conventions (PascalCase.svelte)
- Modal components placed in standardized location (`src/lib/components/modals/`)
- Store actions maintain functional programming patterns
- Test files follow established directory structure and naming

### Testing
